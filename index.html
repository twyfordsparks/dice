        <h2>GAME RULES:</h2>
            <p>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</p>
            <p>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.</p>
            <p>BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
            <p>The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's
                the next player's turn</p>
